# Warning: do not modify

#
# We'd like to sync yadm-managed files through mutagen, but mutagen does not
# support syncing files based on a dynamic list like `yadm ls-files`.
#
# Instead we generate the mutagen config from a template, by using `yadm
# ls-files` to create a list of files to be unignored, and then including that
# file here. (yadm alt will do the templating)
#
# J2 vs default template processor:
#
# Currently we use J2.
#
# The default template processor requires `{ % include "yadm_ls_files.yml" % }` to
# be unindented, so that the resulting file won't have the correct indentation. We
# could work around this by using anchors like so:
#
# .paths: &paths
# - "*"
# { % include ... % }
#
# sync:
#   yadm:
#     ignore:
#       paths: *paths
#
# but this is prevented by https://github.com/mutagen-io/mutagen/issues/432
